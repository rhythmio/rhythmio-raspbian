Rhythm/io for Raspbian
================================================================================

This [SaltStack](http://www.saltstack.com/) scripts can be used to setup and
maintain a hifi server with the raspbian linux distribution and deploy the
Rhythm/io user interface on a raspberry pi.

These scripts are not yet stable but if you feel adventurous take a look at
the [development branch](https://github.com/rhythmio/rhythmio-raspbian/tree/develop).
